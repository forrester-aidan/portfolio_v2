            Hi there! My name is Aidan Forrester and I am an incoming
            fourth-year at the University of Florida, currently pursuing a
            Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Prior to that, I attended
            the Academy for Information Technology, where I completed my high
            school diploma and was issued a vocational I.T. certificate from the
            state of New Jersey. Using my knowledge of different programming
            languages , Iâ€™ve created a multitude of projects ranging from a
            fully-fledged game of Minesweeper to an advanced online car rental
            service.

            Most recently, I was accepted as a Product Intern at Axuall, a
            software company dedicated to improving the clinical-credentialing
            system, allowing recruiters to hire new clinicians faster to help
            patients as soon as possible. As an intern, I was exposed to many
            different area of development, including the product life cycle,
            data prepartion and management with SQL, speaking with shareholders
            and clients, and most importantly the software side. I was involved
            with adding items to the backlog and Kanban board (such as epics,
            user stories, and tasks), researching data online for Redshift
            database integration, and constructing SQL queries to analyze over
            2.5 MILLION clinicians, sorting them based on Medicare enrollment,
            credential type, facility affiliations, and more! Overall, this
            experience has been the greatest stepping stone to my career,
            allowing me to learn and grow at a company that I've enjoyed to the
            fullest!
