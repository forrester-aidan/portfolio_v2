                  Hi there! My name is Aidan Forrester and I am a second-year at the University of Florida, 
                  currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. Prior to that, I attended the Academy 
                  for Information Technology, where I completed my high school diploma and was issued a vocational I.T.
                  certificate from the state of New Jersey. Using my knowledge of different programming languages 
                  (including but not limited to C++, Python, and HTML/CSS/JS), Iâ€™ve created a multitude of projects 
                  ranging from a fully-fledged game of Minesweeper to an advanced online car rental service.

               Recently, I was accepted into a web development team for the Society for Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), 
               where I was in charge of redesigning and programming a brand new website for the society and its sponsors. 
               I'm part of the programming segment of the team, in charge of replicating the design mockups created by others. 
               As a part of this summer, I began my studies of my AI/ML topics with a Machine Learning Specialization online course. 
               This course is designed to teach me the core principles of Machine Learning, such as supervised/unsupervised learning, 
               neural networks, and deep learning. Using libraries/tools such as NumPy, Matplotlib and TensorFlow, 
               I'm able to get a comprehensive and interactive education in the fundamentals of ML.
